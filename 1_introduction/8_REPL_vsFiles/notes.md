The repl is what you use if you just type *node* into your terminal

this is of course an environment where we don't store our code in files but we write our node application with every line. The lines don't work independent from each other.

The alternative to running codes is that you execute files as we did it before 

But the repl is a great playground because we can use that to run some commands, to try out certain things because we execute code as we write it and therefore these are the two ways of running your node code,
